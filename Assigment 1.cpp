A store sells Vadapavs & Samosas. They want a system where they enter the number of Vadapavs (V) and Samosas (S) a customer buys and a bill with the final price is automatically calculated and displayed. A Vadapav costs 12?, while a Samosas costs 15?. Write a program to create such a system.
S = 10, V = 4
S = 5, V = 7
S = 2, V = 8
S = 5, V = 0
Write a program to take two numbers A and B as input from the user and print the number closest to (but less than) A which is completely divisible by B.
For example:

A = 23, B = 7    

For the above case, 21 is the number closest to 23 (A) which is completely divisible by B i.e, 7.

A = 13, B = 5

For the above case, 10 is the number closest to 13 (A) which is completely divisible by B i.e, 5.

A = 17, B = 4
A = 46, B = 6
A = 320, B = 9
A = -28, B = 8
